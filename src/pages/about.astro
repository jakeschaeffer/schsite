			Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a product marketer who's spent the last several years helping developer-focused 
companies grow. I'm currently leading marketing for <a href="https://noir-lang.org" class="cactus-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Noir</a>, 
			a zero-knowledge programming language at <a href="https://aztec.network" class="cactus-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aztec</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p>
			I've been fortunate to work on some interesting projects:
</p>
<ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
			<li><strong>Aztec</strong> — Leading marketing for Noir, an open-source ZK programming language funded by the Ethereum Foundation</li>
			<li><strong>Avail</strong> — First marketing hire; helped spin out from Polygon, launched mainnet at $1.4B valuation, grew blog to 25k+ monthly readers</li>
			<li><strong>Polygon Labs</strong> — Led launches for Polygon ID and Avail, generating millions of impressions</li>
			<li><strong>Namebase</strong> — Built analytics infrastructure processing 3M events/month (acquired by Namecheap)</li>
			<li><strong>AirDev</strong> — Led growth as revenue increased 47%; built ML-driven growth features</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Earlier</h2>
		<p>
			Before marketing, I worked as a machine learning analyst at Goodman Networks, helped plan an ICO 
			at ICONLOOP in Seoul, and was an assistant film composer working on scores for documentaries. 
			I also spent three years at Minerva doing international student outreach across five continents.
		</p>

		<h2>Now</h2>
		<p>
			Outside of work, I track everything I watch (see <a href="/watched/" class="cactus-link">What I Watched</a>), 
			occasionally write, and tinker with side projects.
